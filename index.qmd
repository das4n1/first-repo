```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
storms %>%
  count(year) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n))
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
